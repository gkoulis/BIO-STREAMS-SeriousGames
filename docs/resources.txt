Just improve the following text:

It's like fruit-ninja. But it has many foods.
Each food has a category. e.g. Banana is fruit. Carrot is vegatable. etc
There is a view with instructions.
There is a view with the game.
There is a homepage that presents the page.
The user enters the game. He selects difficulty easy-medium-hard. He selects category.
The game starts after user presses start.
The game starts... there is a nice moving gradient (simple). Foods are droping from top and go to bottom. Speed and quantity is based on difficulty.
User crops the food by slicing the food. If the food belongs to the category user earns a point. If the food does belong to the category user earns a negative point (different counter). If the it mises the food, it earns a missed point (different counter). After a specific count threshold, the games stops the game, provide a reached milistone message and asks user if he wants to conntunue. If yes, it just contunuous. If no, it stops. Moerver, gamme includes pause and stop buttons. Pause, pauses the game. Stop, stops the game and shows the final score...



Could you please provide a fruit-ninja game based on Vue3 and Phaser 3.8?
